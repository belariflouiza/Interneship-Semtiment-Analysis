It lies at the southern border of Afa.   == History ==","In the 16th century the current territory of Afa did not exist as it was a part of the Pieve of La Mezana, a Pieve with a population of about 650 inhabitants in 1520 and with villages called: Sarla, Carcopino, la Punta, Londella, lo Cazille, lo Pogiale, and Opapu. La Mezana, later called the Pieve of Mezzana, was surrounded by:  the Pieve of Aiacio, population of about 500 inhabitants in 1520, which had villages called: Villanova, lo Linare, lo Pogio, Petra, Pozo di Borgo, Aiacio, L'Aia di Joani, li Montichi, and Lata the Pieve of Carceri or Celavo. Celavo had about 1,000 inhabitants in 1520 and had villages called: li Peri, lo Poggio, L'Ulmo, la Salasca, Cortiggiato, Cottoli, Carbuggia, Aogiani, lo Taxo, la Marinchia, Cavalli, Sant'Antonio, lo Poggio di Canivagia, lo Busso, lo Canavagia, Tavera, lo Canipalde, li Muraschi, li Corsachi, li Quercioli, lo Pè de Bocogani, Villanova le Celle, Tavaco, and Vero the Pieve of Cauro later became Sampiero, had about 500 inhabitants in 1520, with villages called: Bastelica, le Dominicaggie, le Emportagie, la Statione, le Follagie, la Valle, Santo, la Castellagie, le Vassellagie, Cauro, Ecosa, la Suarella, la Casavecchia, lo Poggio, Tola, Ocana, lo Piglio, Chena, la Salvolaggia, Zizoli, and Frasso the Pieve of Ginerca (or Cinerca) with 3000 inhabitants in 1520 and with villages called: Calcatojo, Sant'Andria, le Canelle, Sari, Casagiuni, Ambiegni, Lopigna, and Airo. At the beginning of the 18th  century, Afa continued in the Pieve Mezzana until 1789 when it became the canton of Sarrola-Carcopino. Originally the village of Afa was a hamlet in the commune of Bocognano. In 1851 Afa became a municipality of the canton of Sarrola-Carcopino in the department of Corsica. The commune of Afa was created through land abandonment by Sarrola-Carcopino and the Valle-di-Mezzana (I Vaddi di Mezana). The first mayor of Afa was called Carlo Calvelli and he was elected in 1852 and remained until his death in 1858 at the age of 48 years. The village was populated by shepherds from Bocognano during the migration of sheep to summer pastures. This explains the bocognanaise origin of old families in Afa. In summer, many Afaiens return to the village of Bocognano.","The creation of the commune was the result of a report by Pongérard during the session of the National Assembly of 25 July 1850 that created the commune of Afa. The report read in part: ""Gentlemen, the communes of Valle-di-Mezzana and of Bocognano in the district of Ajaccio, Corsica department, have two portions of territory which not only have the status of enclaves, but the distance separating them from their respective communes is some Six Leagues. Since the two enclaves are contiguous and together have an area of 1.2 hectares with three groups of houses, and a population of about 350 souls, it seems appropriate to create a separate commune under the name of Affa."" ""The inhabitants of these enclaves join with their Municipal Councils to ask for the maintenance of the current state of affairs. Most of the principle Administrators and regulations of the land registry demand the removal of these enclaves. There must necessarily be a distinct old commune, or to join them as is proposed in the course of the instruction to the commune of Sarrola. The first of these remedial measures is obviously more advantageous to the people, at least in the opinion of the Administrative Authorities and the elected councillors of the arrondissement and of the department. They appeared certain that the establishment of an administrative centre in the middle of nomadic populations today, would change their habits and lead to improvement in their Agriculture and Industry. Also they would become a source of well-being and prosperity."" ""Bocognano and Valle-Mezzana who, in all these cases, must lose the enclaved territories, not in keeping the ""Forte Une"" elements of the municipal organisation. Not that this operation is not important for Bocognano who has administered an enclave of 1100 hectares for a long time and which will almost entirely be within the proposed commune. They will have nevertheless a territorial area of over 5,000 hectares and a population of more than 2,000 inhabitants. About Valle-Mezzana, they will only give up 115 hectares which are uninhabited."" ""The formation of the new commune of Affa will modify the district of the canton which Bocognano is in. The administrative authorities, such as the Minister of Justice, have, in effect, been advised that it should be attributed to the canton of Sarrola-Carcopino. Moreover Affa is not large enough, nor has enough people for the loss of its territory to the canton of Bocognano to be a significant loss.""","1954: The canton of Ajaccio is created with the communes of: Afa, Ajaccio, Alata, Appin, Bastelicaccia, and Villanova. 1975: With the division of the island of Corsica into two departments, Afa passed into the department of Corse-du-Sud.   == Administration ==  List of Successive Mayors of Afa   == Population == The inhabitants are called Afayens ([afajɛ̃]) or Afayennes ([afajɛn]) in French, afaghjinchi (singular: afaghjincu, afaghjinca) in Corsican, and afaianesi (singular: afaianese) historically in Italian.   == Education == Afa has:  a primary school and a public kindergarten, with a canteen in Murone.
